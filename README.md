# Java 2D Graphics Assignments
Created by me

## Course Description
Every week, I had to make new assignments to learn 2D Graphics in Java. The functionality would be described on the school page.
In the end I had to make one final assignment which had to comply with the following requirements:
- Update and draw code has to be seperated.
- Use a gradientpaint with an animation.
- Show text on the screen, which you can drag around without jumping everywhere.
- The text has to be scaleable by the user. The gradientpaint also has to scale with the text.
